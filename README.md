# Space_Shooter_Game
Top-down shooter demonstrating recoil physics, vector math, and real-time gameplay using Python and Pygame.

**Space_Shooter_Game** is a minimalist top-down arcade shooter built with **Python and Pygame**, featuring a unique recoil-based movement system. Instead of traditional WASD controls, the player navigates entirely through the physics of weapon recoil, creating a fast-paced and skill-driven gameplay experience.

## 🎮 Core Idea

You are floating in zero gravity. The only way to move is by firing your weapon — every shot pushes you in the opposite direction.

To survive, you must carefully balance attacking enemies while controlling your momentum, turning movement into a strategic challenge.
